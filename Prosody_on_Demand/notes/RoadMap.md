# Prosody-on-Demand: Complete Development Roadmap
## Parallel Track Development: Demo + Dataset + Model Training

**Timeline:** 22 weeks (6-week sprint + 16-week development)  
**Time Commitment:** 10 hours/week  
**Start Date:** October 21, 2025  
**Sprint Target:** November 26, 2025 (Jane meeting)  
**Phase 1 Complete:** March 2026  

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Dual Objectives

### Track A: Sprint (Demo for Jane)
- Live web demo by Nov 26
- Integration roadmap document
- SONA-specific use cases
- Presentation materials

### Track B: Research (Dataset + Engine)
- 450+ validated pairs by Dec 1
- 1000+ entries by Jan 31
- Custom trained model by March
- Published research output

**Key Principle:** Every hour serves both tracks. Every demo test = dataset entry. Every prompt experiment = training data. No wasted work.

---

## ðŸ“Š Weekly Time Allocation

```
Each Week (10 hours total):
â”œâ”€ 6 hours: Core development (benefits both tracks)
â”œâ”€ 2 hours: Demo-specific work (Track A)
â””â”€ 2 hours: Dataset/research work (Track B)
```

# Notes & Reminders

**Remember:**
- Every demo test contributes to your dataset
- Quality > Quantity in dataset collection
- Document everything as you go
- Version control is your friend
- Rest is part of the process

**You've got this! ðŸš€**

Start tomorrow with confidence. The roadmap is clear, the timeline is realistic, and the dual-track approach ensures no wasted effort.

Good luck with Jane and with building something transformative!
